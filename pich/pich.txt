• Game idea (short description) 
The game idea that I have will be a game that consist on surviving rounds, like surviving to zombies that come every round or space ship, every round 2-3 bust will be drop there it could be 2 type of bust for example bust that is for a certain amount of time and one bust that is permanently, the bust that is for a certain amount of time it could be like special effects for the player like run faster or make the enemy’s slower etc.  And the permanent drops it could give you extra health or maybe armor or weapon upgrades

• Scenario and characters description (include placeholder graphics, drafts, references).
The character it could be a human trying to survive zombies or a ship trying to survive an alien invasion (it doesn’t really matter what the character is we can discuss what can it be ) the world will be run in space or the earth.

• Characters’ actions and goals. 
The goal of this game is to survive ass much round ass possible or to survive a certain amount of round in a certain amount of time the less time u make the most points you make. The character will have a gun that shoot one bullet at the time and when you kill zombies or space ship they will drop bust that will give you special things like for example instead of shooting one bullet know you will shoot 2 bullets at the time(there it could be more bust )

• Game Win/Lose conditions 
Ass I say the game could be in survive ass much ass you can and never end or it could end after finishing 6-10 rounds and the faster you finish the more points you will gain 

• Progression of levels 
The progression of the levels it could be in every level or round stronger zombies appear for example a zombie whit a bit more life that when you kill him 2 standard zombies appear or a zombie that it have lot of health another zombie it could be that when you are close to him it explote and it makes you lot off damage etc. Also every level or every 3-4 rounds the scenario it could change and whit this stronger zombies could  appear.

• Sources of inspiration (other games, movies, etc that inspired your idea) 
I got inspired in call of duty zombie and also in Minecraft mobs apart from the typically space ship 2d games.

• What skills/interests you are looking for in a team mate
I’m looking people that are interesting in working in this idea also that are going to work hard and try their best apart that have ideas to improve the game.
